  # http://www.gamedev.net/topic/104528-triangleplane-intersection-points/
  # The idea is to test each and every edge (line) of the triangle to see if it collides with the plane. There are three lines:
  #   P0-P1
  #   P1-P2
  #   P2-P0
  # 
  #   For example, with P0-P1, any point on the line can be represented as a linear interpolation between P0-P1. Hence,
  # 
  #   P = P0 + t * (P1 - P0)
  # 
  #   If 0 < t < 1, then P is somewhere between P1 and P0. This is a vectorial equation, so there are three components. We can substitute them in the plane equation:
  # 
  #   Ax + By + Cz + D = 0
  #   A(P0.x + t * (P1.x - P0.x)) + B(P0.y + t * ... = 0
  # 
  #   Isolate t. Once you have it, you know that, if t>1 or t<0, the edge doesn''t intersect the plane. Else, you can find the intersection point by replacing t in the original equation.
  #
