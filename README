The purpose of this project is to convert 3d assets in [COLLADA format][] into a format suitable
for building out of LEGO bricks, particularly in the [LDraw file format][].

Why?  Well, I thought it'd be fun, as I love LEGOs and thought it'd be cool to automatically
generate a lego version of 3d models.

The COLLADA library I am using is [pycollada].  You must install it and its dependencies first.  
This can be tricky, especially on a mac for the lxml dependency.  See [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1277124/how-do-you-install-lxml-on-os-x-leopard-without-using-macports-or-fink) for more help.

I had to find libxml2-2.7.3.tar.gz at http://code.google.com/p/autosetup1/downloads/detail?name=libxml2-2.7.3.tar.gz&can=2&q=
libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz http://code.google.com/p/savory/downloads/detail?name=libxslt-1.1.24.tar.gz&can=2&q=


The LDraw library I use can be found at http://www.boddie.org.uk/david/Projects/Python/ldraw/
