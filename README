The purpose of this project is to convert 3d assets in [COLLADA format][] into a format suitable
for building out of LEGO bricks, particularly in the [LDraw file format][].

Why?  Well, I thought it'd be fun, as I love LEGOs and thought it'd be cool to automatically
generate a lego version of 3d models.

The COLLADA library I am using is [pycollada].  You must install it and its dependencies first.  
If you have easy_install setup, that is as easy as

	easy_install lxml

[lxml][] http://lxml.de/installation.html
